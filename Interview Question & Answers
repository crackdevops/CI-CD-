HOW TO ANSWER CICD PROCESS IN AN INTERVIEW :

Once the user commits the code to a git repository then we use jenkins as a orchestrater which takes care of our continous integration part using multiple stages 
We use jenkins groovy scripting where we use jenkins declarative pipelines for writing stages as part of it 
The first stage is checkout-stage where we checkout the stage.
The second stage is Build and Unit Testing we also perform static code analysis. 
Then we move towards the Code Scanning stage and once the code scanning is done if everything is finewe will move towards the building of image.
In this case we are building container image because the target platform is kubernetes.
Then we perform the image scanning to verify that the image build is safe from the security vulerabilities and finally we push this image to the image registry.
We take the new version of image and We update the k8s yaml manifests or we update the helm charts on to a git repository(git repository can be a different one or same one) 
Finally we have a GitOps tool ArgoCD which is watching from this helm charts whenever there is a new code commit or new version that is made to this git repository
It picks up the new commit and deploy it's on to the k8s cluster.



Question 1: What is CI?
Answer: CI stands for Continuous Integration. It is a DevOps software development methodology. It is a process of integrating the code changes that are done by various developers into the shared project repository. 

Question 2: What is the use of CI?
Answer: CI is used to merge the code changes that are done by one or many contributors into the project repository. 

Question 3: What is DevOps?
Answer: In the word DevOps, Dev stands for development, and Ops stands for operations. It is a software methodology that includes tools, which further help in communicating, integrating, and collaborating in the development cycle.

Question 4: What is the CD?
Answer: CD stands for continuous delivery. It is a software engineering approach. Continuous delivery works with continuous integration in order to make a complete flow, which helps in delivering code packages.

Question 5: What is Git?
Answer: Git is open-source software. It allows data integrity and manages workflows easily. Git gives a way to coordinate among team members easily.

Question 6: What is version control?
Answer:  Version control allows tracking all changes made in the source code.

Question 7: What is Continuous Deployment?
Answer: Continuous deployment can be defined as a software development strategy. It allows the release of code changes that are done in an application into the production environment automatically. 

Question 8: What is Continuous Testing?
Answer: Continuous testing is the process of testing in which manual steps of testing are eliminated. Automated routines are set up, which helps in reducing human work. 

Question 9: Why is Continuous Testing important?
Answer: Continuous testing is important in DevOps. As it eliminates human efforts. And also decreases the errors that might occur due to manual testing.

Question 10: What is the DevOps pipeline?
Answer: The DevOps pipeline can be defined as the processes and tools. This allows developers(Dev) and operations(Ops) to work together. It is useful in deploying code changes to the production environment.
